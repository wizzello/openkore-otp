# OTP Plugin for OpenKore

## ‚ú™ Overview

OTP is a plugin for **OpenKore** that automatically handles Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) authentication during login.
It listens for OTP requests and generates the correct TOTP code using the seed provided in your `config.txt`.

‚úÖ Compatible with servers that require OTP during login.
‚úÖ Lightweight and written purely in Perl, no external dependencies beyond OpenKore.

## ‚öô Requirements

* OpenKore (recent version with plugin system support)
* A **Base32-encoded OTP seed** (provided by your game account)
* Perl modules:
  * `Digest::SHA`

---

## üöÄ Installation

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Place the plugin**

Download `otp.pl` and put it in your OpenKore `plugins/` directory:

```
/openkore/plugins/OTP/otp.pl
```

Download `Core.pm` and `Utils.pm` and put it in your OpenKore `plugins/OTP` directory:

```
/openkore/plugins/OTP/OTP/Core.pm
/openkore/plugins/OTP/OTP/Utils.pm
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure your OTP seed**

In your `config.txt` add your seed:

```
otpSeed T0TPS33DROL4S3RV
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Modify OpenKore source (important!)**

‚ö† **OpenKore does not trigger a hook for OTP requests by default.**
You must modify `src/Network/Receive.pm`:

Find the method:

```perl
sub received_login_token {
```

And replace this part:

```perl
sub received_login_token {
	my ($self, $args) = @_;
	# XKore mode 1 / 3.
	return if ($self->{net}->version == 1);
	my $master = $masterServers{$config{master}};

	# rathena use 0064 not 0825
	$messageSender->sendTokenToServer($config{username}, $config{password}, $master->{master_version}, $master->{version}, $args->{login_token}, $args->{len}, $master->{OTP_ip}, $master->{OTP_port});
}
```

üëâ With:

```perl
sub received_login_token {
	my ($self, $args) = @_;
	# XKore mode 1 / 3.
	return if ($self->{net}->version == 1);
	my $master = $masterServers{$config{master}};
	return 0 if (length($args->{login_token}) == 0);
	# rathena use 0064 not 0825
	$messageSender->sendTokenToServer($config{username}, $config{password}, $master->{master_version}, $master->{version}, $args->{login_token}, $args->{len}, $master->{OTP_ip}, $master->{OTP_port});
}
```

This change allows your plugin to handle and send the OTP.

## ‚ö† Why is Receive.pm modification required?

OpenKore does not provide a built-in trigger for OTP (One-Time Password) requests when the server sends the relevant packet (e.g., `0AE3`). Although our plugin no longer needs to introduce a completely new hook, a small modification in `Receive.pm` is still necessary. This adjustment ensures that OpenKore properly calls an existing hook or passes the OTP request in a way that the plugin can detect and respond to it.

‚û° Without this modification, the plugin would not receive notification when the server expects the OTP code, and the automated login flow would not complete successfully.
‚û° The modification is minimal and only ensures the correct event is fired ‚Äî no new hooks or extensive changes to OpenKore core are needed.

## üìù Example `config.txt`

```
master Latam - ROla: Freya/Nidhogg/Yggdrasil
server 0
username exemple@mail.com
password Str0ngP4ssW0rd
loginPinCode 0123
char 0
otpSeed T0TPS33DROL4S3RV
```

---

## üîë How it works

* Server sends a `0AE3` packet requesting an OTP code.
* Modified `Receive.pm` triggers: `Plugins::callHook('login_token_requested', $messageSender);`
* The plugin generates a valid TOTP code and sends it to the server.
* Login continues automatically.

## Special Thanks

This plugin was made possible thanks to contributions, ideas, and support from:

- **pogramos** ‚Äì for the idea of creating a custom Base32 decoder instead of using external libraries.
- **SilverPhoenix28** ‚Äì for sharing the way to handle OTP through `received_login_token` and `$messageSender`.
- **OpenKore Community** ‚Äì for testing, feedback, and code reviews.

We appreciate every idea, report, and line of code that made this plugin better!
